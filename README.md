How the vault works and the contract of the vault 

User deposits some amount of tokens into the vault contract and gets a certain amount of mint shares depending upon the amount he deposited and the total shares at that moment of time .
The shares which has to be mint depends upon the equation _____   s = (a*T)/B    ______   { a = token amount , T = totalsupply of shares , B = Balance of the vault }

The owner of the vault contract withdrawls the tokens and invests it into some DEFI project , where after making profit or loss he deposits the total token amount in the vault contract .

The user can then withdraw depending upon the total shares they have of the vault contract . The total amount to be withdrawl is calculated by the equation 
______   a = s*B / T    ______ . The total shares of that user is burned .
